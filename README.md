# Overview

I Work with Ansible in [WSL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux), my `./ssh/config` file has the connection
data to all the serves that I manage, this tool reads that file and show a grid with all the hosts and give the possibility to
stablish a SSH session using the new Windows [Terminal](https://github.com/microsoft/terminal) and a SFTP session
using [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php) by clicking in a button.
